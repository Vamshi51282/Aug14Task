 <p id="b">Sammakka Saralamma Jatara (also Sammakka Sarakka Jatara and Medaram Jatara)[1] is a festival to honour the Hindu Tribal goddesses, celebrated in the state of Telangana, India. This Jatara is known for witnessing one of the largest human gatherings in the world. People offer Bellam (jaggery), locally called as Bangaram, to the deities. The Jatara begins at Medaram in Tadvai Mandala in Mulugu district. The rituals related to the Goddesses are entirely performed by the Koya Tribe priests, in accordance with Koya customs and traditions.Until 1955, about 2,000 people used to visit Medaram, of whom the majority (1,500) belonged to the Koya tribe. But now a large number of non-Koya pilgrims (1.3 crore) visit Medaram and the Koya people comprise only 2% of the total worshippers.Medaram is a remote place in the Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary, a part of Dandakaranya, the largest surviving forest belt in the Deccan.Once declared a national festival, the jatara can be considered for 'intangible cultural heritage of humanity' tag of UNESCO.[citation needed] The Jatara is celebrated during the time the goddesses (Sammakka and Saralamma) of the tribals are believed to visit them. It is believed that after Kumbha Mela, the Sammakka Saralamma Jatara attracts the largest number of devotes in the country.There are many legends about the miraculous powers of Sammakka. According to a 13th-century tribal legend, some tribal leaders on a hunt found a newborn girl (Sammakka) enveloped in light playing amidst tigers. They took her to the tribal chief .She later became the saviour of the tribals of the region. She was married to Pagididda Raju, the tribal chief of the Koyas. Medaram was ruled by the Kakatiyas (with their headquarters in Warangal city between 1000 AD and 1323 AD). Sammakka had two daughters and one son, Sarakka alias Saralamma, Nagulamma, and Jampanna. King Prataprudra of the Kakatiyas imposed taxes on the Koya Tribe, which they could not pay. As a result, King Prataprudra declared war on the Koya Tribe. Pagididda Raju was killed in the ensuing battle forcing the Sammakka to pick up the fight with her daughter Saralamma, her son Jampanna, and her son-in-law Govinda Raju. Sammakka had almost won when Saralamma died in the battle. Jampanna was mortally into Sampangi vaagu (stream). Legend has it that the stream turned red from the blood, and the stream was renamed "Jampanna Vaagu" in honour of Jampanna's sacrifice. Distraught, Sammakka retired to a hill called Chilakala Gutta and turned into a (kumkuma bharani) jar filled with kumkuma powder. After the battle, Sammakka and Saralamma were deified and a festival was organized in her honour once every 2 years. To this day, the Koya tribe and devotees believe Sammakka and Saralamma are manifestations of Adi Parashakti sent to protect them.The jatara is a celebration to honour this sacrifice. The Kumkuma jar is brought to Medaram and people wash themselves in Jampanna Vaagu, followed by an offering of Jaggery to Sammakka and Saralamma.
